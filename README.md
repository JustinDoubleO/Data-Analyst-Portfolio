## About

Hi, I'm Ye Min Oo! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a major in Data Analytics & Business Information System Management from the University of Technology Sydney. With a strong academic background and a passion for leveraging data to drive insights, I am enthusiastic about contributing to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I've developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends in complex datasets. My coursework has equipped me with skills in data analysis, software engineering, business system modeling, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. I've also gained practical experience as an entrepreneur at Astro Brewhouse in Myanmar, where I implemented data-driven marketing strategies and utilized data analysis for strategic decision-making.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and using data to solve complex problems.
