## About

Hi, I'm Ye Min Oo! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a major in Data Analytics & Business Information System Management from the University of Technology Sydney. With a strong academic background and a passion for leveraging data to drive insights, I am enthusiastic about contributing to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I've developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends in complex datasets. My coursework has equipped me with skills in data analysis, software engineering, business system modeling, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. I've also gained practical experience as an entrepreneur at Astro Brewhouse in Myanmar, where I implemented data-driven marketing strategies and utilized data analysis for strategic decision-making.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and using data to solve complex problems.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

## Sandringham Dataset Analysis

- **Report**: [Sandringham Dataset Analysis Report (PDF)](https://github.com/JustinDoubleO/Portfolio-Projects/blob/8be788ab1fb7c941324cf878fcf78108ef2d3f1e/Sandringham%20Dataset%20Analysis%20Report.pdf)
- **Dataset**: [Sandringham Dataset (Excel)](https://github.com/JustinDoubleO/Portfolio-Projects/blob/8be788ab1fb7c941324cf878fcf78108ef2d3f1e/Sandringham%20Dataset.xlsx)

#### Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze comprehensive data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) covering the suburb of Sandringham, focusing on its property market, demographics, and economic indicators over a span of 20 years.

#### Description

The Sandringham Dataset Analysis project explores various facets of Sandringham's community, including property median prices, ownership patterns, population dynamics, employment status, and more. By leveraging data visualization techniques, the project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights within the dataset.

#### Skills

- Data Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis
- Report Writing

#### Result

The analysis revealed several key findings:

1. Population growth was relatively stagnant over the 20-year period, with minor fluctuations observed.
2. Median house prices experienced a steady increase, while unit prices showed more variability.
3. Employment dynamics exhibited shifts, with fluctuations in full-time, part-time, and unemployment rates over time.
4. Changes in housing tenure and family compositions were observed, reflecting evolving demographic trends.

#### Conclusion

The Sandringham Dataset Analysis project provides valuable insights into the dynamics of Sandringham's community and housing market. By analyzing and visualizing the dataset, this project contributes to a better understanding of trends and patterns within the suburb, which can inform decision-making processes for stakeholders and policymakers.

## US Open Dataset Analysis

- **Report:** [Executive Summary (PDF)](link_to_report_pdf)
- **Dataset:** [US Open Dataset (Excel)](link_to_excel_file)

#### Sample Dataset

The US Tennis Open event, one of the most esteemed tennis competitions in the world, and the fourth and final Grand Slam competition of the year, served as the dataset for Assignment 2. It has 141 years' worth of men's and women's championship games from 1881 to 2021.

276 sample records and 22 attributes make up the dataset's original structure. Even though there are 22 attributes, Champion Seed, Mins, and Runner-up Seed are not provided for this assignment. The available characteristics are listed below.

#### Goal of the Project

In order to analyze a high-dimensional dataset from US Tennis Open match records, this paper employs advanced data visualization techniques. The dataset has 22 characteristics and 276 example records. Using the analytical visualization application Tableau, visualization techniques like TreeMap, Parallel Coordinate, Geographic Mapping, and others are applied to the dataset. The report provides information on the data properties, data pre-processing procedures, and analysis of the various approaches used. There is also a conclusion that summarizes the main findings.

#### Description

The US Open Dataset Analysis project explores various visualization techniques applied to the dataset of US Tennis Open match records. Techniques such as TreeMap, Parallel Coordinate, and Geographic Mapping are employed to analyze trends in match outcomes, player performances, and geographical distribution of champions.

#### Skills 

- Data Visualization
- Tableau
- Data Analysis
- Statistical Analysis
- Report Writing

#### Result

The analysis revealed several key findings:

- The distribution of champions across different countries and genders.
- Trends in match outcomes and player performances over time.
- Geographic distribution of champions and the popularity of tennis across different regions.
